## Configuration

### `config.json`

- `ip`: Minecraft server IP
- `port`: Minecraft server port
- `channel`: Discord channel ID for notifications
- `panelLink`: Link to the Pterodactyl panel (optional)
- `serverId`: Server ID on the panel (optional)
- `apiKey`: API key for the panel (optional)
- `guildOwner`: Discord guild owner ID
- `restartTimeout`: Timeout ID for automatic restart attempts
- `offlineNotified`: Boolean flag for offline notifications
